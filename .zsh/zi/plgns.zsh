zi ice wait'!0' lucid                     ## lucid mode to speed up stuff
zi light zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting ## gives color to prompts, looks good and also attempts to copy the fish shell's look

zi ice wait'!0' lucid                     ## lucid mode to speed up stuff
zi light marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete     ## this is personal preference but it will basically give you (good) completion for various stuff

zi light zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions      ## previously runned commands will have a grayish look, kinda like the friendly interactive shell

### NOTE: if you want a list of plugins go to "awesome-zsh-plugins" and find one that catches your attention!
### ANOTHER NOTE: we use "zi" here as it is a shorthand for "zinit", kindof like an alias!
### if you're asking "why?" then take a look at this post: https://reddit.invak.id/r/zsh/comments/sqsni7/zshellzi_vs_zdharmacontinuumzinit/
### "zini" should also work; use zi if you care about characters inside code so much like me
